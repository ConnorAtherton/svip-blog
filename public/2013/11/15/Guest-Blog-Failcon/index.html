        <p>This Monday I went to my first conference. It was FailCon which is a conference where people from tech stand up in front of a room and talk about their failures. The idea stems from a core value in the valley, which is that failure is OK. Many people attribute the bay area’s success to this philosophy, as people are given a second chance, learn from their mistakes and are more likely to succeed in further endeavours.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>There was a lot of content in the talks, and as it would be slightly overwhelming I’ll do some summaries of the talks I particularly enjoyed.</p>
<p>The first talk was given by Miki Johnson and Jackson Solway, a couple who started a company together. Their failure came when they noticed that they had two totally different hopes for the business they were creating. Startups can generally follow two routes: venture capital funding and organic growth. The first is “get big quick”, where your investors fund you, but push you hard for it; organic growth is as it sounds, the company grows within its means, using profit for growth. The problem was that one wanted the first option, and the other wanted the second. As two co-founders you can see how this caused a rift which wasn’t solvable with discussion. Miki has a fantastic blog post on the topic, and how to predict if this may happen to you, <a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/96540ba28355" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/failcon1.jpg" alt="Why we fail"></p>
<p>Victor Lombardi presented a talk based on his book Why We Fail, in which he investigates the trends of failure in the tech industry. He covered a few examples of companies who seemed to have similar products, at similar times, with similar market shares, where one went on to become huge, and the other flopped; his question is why? He suggests that you can drop each of these failures into one of four groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Audience</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Technology</li>
</ul>
<p>One message which particularly hit me was “take your assumptions about your customers as a hypothesis and test them scientifically”. Never take something which you think “yeh, our customers definitely want that” as the truth. Take a survey, ask them what they think, and if the answer doesn’t come back how you expect then you’ve saved yourself a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>Jon Crawford, a founder of Storenvy.com (<a href="http://joncrawford.com/post/20378314843/how-i-got-kicked-out-of-y-combinator-and-then-raised" target="_blank" rel="external">who was kicked out of YC</a>, but that’s another story) gave a talk which gave importance to something which I previously hadn’t thought much about: culture. He talked about the importance of having a set list of company mantras which every decision is made by, and having that list visible to new employees so that your company is aligned in its purpose. He made a very apt simile: employees effort is like vectors, if they are in different directions, their vector product sums to very little.</p>

<p>Gleb Budman of Backblaze wasted a million dollars on advertising. Gleb was told that he had a million dollars to spend on advertising, and it was his job to spend it wisely; this was big as his company had never had this much money to spend before, so they went off the wagon. <a href="http://blog.backblaze.com/2013/05/16/as-seen-on-ellen/" target="_blank" rel="external">This blog post</a> shows how they decided to target “moms” (they sell backup software…) by buying a prime slot ON the Ellen DeGeneres show and giving everyone in the audience an ipad mini with their software on. This stunt alone cost the company around $300,000 and they managed to waste almost all the rest targeting the same market. You might think this sounds awesome, except that mums weren’t interested! They were never going to buy it, no matter how much it was flaunted in front of them. The take away message is “find your niche and double down”.</p>
<p>In summary, I learnt a lot and think that I need to go to more conferences in the future as I feel like just being there improved my chances of ever being successful in my own startup.</p>
