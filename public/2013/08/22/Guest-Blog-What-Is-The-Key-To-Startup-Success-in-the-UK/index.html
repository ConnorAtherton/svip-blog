        <p>With my graduation ceremony marking the end of one journey tomorrow, a new journey awaits me when I move to San Francisco this September. I feel very fortunate to be part of the inaugural class of the Silicon Valley Internship Programme. You can watch my 1-minute video intro <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O35tgpQD8bg" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>I began preparing for the journey ahead of me by attending the <a href="http://www.pubsummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pubsummit</a> event on July 8th, hosted by <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/07/02/come-hang-out-with-gigaom-in-london-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="external">GigaOM</a>; I wasn’t sure what to expect, as this was the first networking event I have attended in a bar!

<p>One of my goals for my year in the Silicon Valley is to pick up the skills necessary to run a successful startup when I return to the UK. To prepare for this, I decided to ask everyone I spoke with about what they thought was important for new startups and the startup community in the UK as a whole.</p>
<p>Having ordered a Tequila Lemonade, I put on my investigative hat and began taking part in some very interesting conversations.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/xenophin" target="_blank" rel="external">Xen Lategan</a> from <a href="http://pxi.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">PXi Ventures</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You want the pressure of an investor. When you bootstrap, it may be safe but your velocity is also low.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alokmatta" target="_blank" rel="external">Alok Matta</a> who has quit the corporate sphere in order to explore the startup world said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is lack of creativity in Europe. Instead of copying what has already been done and trying to solve problems that are not there, we need to focus on innovation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/annadahlstrom" target="_blank" rel="external">Anna Dahlström</a>, a freelancing UX designer and founder of <a href="http://www.byflock.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">byflock</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Know your priorities. It’s easy to get sidetracked.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/key2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/daniellevy1" target="_blank" rel="external">Daniel Levy</a>, the CEO of <a href="http://www.streetlike.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">StreetLike</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Get mentors as soon as you can; find people who have done what you are trying to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alec Dent, from <a href="http://www.blablacar.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BlaBlaCar</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“More people need to be willing to take the risk.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Kat_Procopiou" target="_blank" rel="external">Katherine Procopiou</a>, from <a href="http://nexmo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Nexmo</a> (a worth checking out SMS API) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People need to commit beyond the 9-5 and be passionate. For this to happen we need larger scale events to connect more people and higher profile speakers to inspire the community here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/peterryder16" target="_blank" rel="external">Peter Ryder</a>, the co-founder of <a href="http://www.inkly.me/" target="_blank" rel="external">Inkly</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Network, but don’t go looking for specific things; instead be open to opportunities. Go to events and just talk to different people. You don’t have to talk to everyone either. We got everything through networking!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really liked the informal and relaxed atmosphere throughout and was very impressed with the calibre of people in attendance. It is something I would definitely recommend to anyone in the startup world. I am looking forward to more events like this!</p>
<p>I’d like to give special thanks to Patti Silverman (SVIP Program Manager) who made me aware of this fun event and to <a href="https://twitter.com/hoshsadiq" target="_blank" rel="external">Hoshang Sadiq</a> my good friend and <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/news/2013/ProjectFair/" target="_blank" rel="external">co-founder</a>, for helping me put together the material for this post.</p>
<p>What do you think is the key to startup success in the UK?</p>
