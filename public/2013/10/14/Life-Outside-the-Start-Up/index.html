<p>This weekend SVIP interns Paul Wozniak and Stewart Taylor took part in a hackathon hosted by <a href="http://hellahackoakland.splashthat.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pandora</a>. “Make something cool with music” they said. “You have 32 hours. Go.”</p>
<p><img src="/img/life1.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/img/life2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We do have to give some credit to another SVIP intern, Mike Howell, here. Quote “Why would I want to spend all week programming for my start up, every evening working on my own project AND devote my weekend to staring at a computer screen?” Contrary to popular opinion, the SVIP does accept non super-geek candidates who like fresh air and daylight. Did we mention that there happens to be an Olympic class ski resort at Squaw Valley, just a few hours drive from San Francisco?</p>
<p>That said, Paul and Stewart did an awesome job representing the SVIP. Not only did they come up with working product that streams music based on your mood, they won. That means a free month of co-working space to launch it from, courtesy of <a href="http://www.portoffices.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Port Work Spaces</a>, and even more time to devote to getting square eyes. Watch this space.</p>
<p>You can also check out Paul’s blog about the experience <a href="http://paulwozniak.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/my-first-hackathon-hella-hack/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
