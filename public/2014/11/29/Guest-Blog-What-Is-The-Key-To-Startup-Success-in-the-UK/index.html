        <p>Guest Blog: What Is The Key To Startup Success in the UK?<br>by Paul Wozniak</p>
<p>With my graduation ceremony marking the end of one journey tomorrow, a new journey awaits me when I move to San Francisco this September. I feel very fortunate to be part of the inaugural class of the Silicon Valley Internship Programme. You can watch my 1-minute video intro here.<br>I began preparing for the journey ahead of me by attending the Pubsummit event on July 8th, hosted by GigaOM; I wasn’t sure what to expect, as this was the first networking event I have attended in a bar! It was a warm and sunny evening in the city so I was relieved to find upon arrival that the venue was shaded. Courtesy of the kind folks at Gecoboard, I was immediately given two free drinks vouchers. There was a welcoming buzz of conversation in the air and I couldn’t wait to get involved.<br>One of my goals for my year in the Silicon Valley is to pick up the skills necessary to run a successful startup when I return to the UK. To prepare for this, I decided to ask everyone I spoke with about what they thought was important for new startups and the startup community in the UK as a whole.<br>Having ordered a Tequila Lemonade, I put on my investigative hat and began taking part in some very interesting conversations.<br>Xen Lategan from PXi Ventures said:<br>“You want the pressure of an investor. When you bootstrap, it may be safe but your velocity is also low.”<br>Alok Matta who has quit the corporate sphere in order to explore the startup world said:<br>“There is lack of creativity in Europe. Instead of copying what has already been done and trying to solve problems that are not there, we need to focus on innovation.”<br>Anna Dahlström, a freelancing UX designer and founder of byflock said:<br>“Know your priorities. It’s easy to get sidetracked.”</p>
<p>Daniel Levy, the CEO of StreetLike said:<br>“Get mentors as soon as you can; find people who have done what you are trying to do.”<br>Alec Dent, from BlaBlaCar said:<br>“More people need to be willing to take the risk.”<br>Katherine Procopiou, from Nexmo (a worth checking out SMS API) said:<br>“People need to commit beyond the 9-5 and be passionate. For this to happen we need larger scale events to connect more people and higher profile speakers to inspire the community here.”<br>Peter Ryder, the co-founder of Inkly said:<br>“Network, but don’t go looking for specific things; instead be open to opportunities. Go to events and just talk to different people. You don’t have to talk to everyone either. We got everything through networking!”<br>I really liked the informal and relaxed atmosphere throughout and was very impressed with the calibre of people in attendance. It is something I would definitely recommend to anyone in the startup world. I am looking forward to more events like this!<br>I’d like to give special thanks to Patti Silverman (SVIP Program Manager) who made me aware of this fun event and to Hoshang Sadiq my good friend and co-founder, for helping me put together the material for this post.</p>
<p>What do you think is the key to startup success in the UK?</p>
