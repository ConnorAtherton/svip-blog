        <p>Guest Blog: SVIP Class of 2013 lands in San Francisco<br>by Marat Subkhankulov<br>It’s been a long time coming for this year’s successful SVIP applicants. Spring and Summer were spent in interviews, match making with the startups, getting accepted (!), putting together visa paperwork, fedexing forms and queueing for the visa interviews. A process that was most aptly documented by Chris Atkin-Granville on his blog where he discusses choosing offers and the visa interview.</p>
<p>Glen park burrito<br>First night in Hacker House, Nick and Mario enjoying a hearty burrito.</p>
<p>Our flight departed from Heathrow airport. I had stayed in London overnight and enjoyed a late morning underground commute to the terminal. The Facebook thread read “Meeting area D”, and upon arriving I noticed someone who looked like Nick’s Facebook photo. The recognition of a kindred SVIPer sparked our conversation. Then there was Michael, trying to get his massive ski bag on the plane, ready to hit the slopes. Identifying him was more problematic, since his Facebook profile photo was that of Iron Man. Most of us we were meeting for the first time and it sure felt surreal.<br>A security gate here, a meal there and we were San Francisco bound. The 11 hour flight was spent watching in-flight movies, chatting and sleeping.<br>Upon our arrival a pre-booked shuttle took us to our new home. Most of the interns were staying together for the first month in a ‘hacker house’. OK, admittedly it’s a glorified hostel. But it is a pretty cool idea – throw a load of developers together in a relatively small space, usually people in the process of dreaming up their own start-ups and see what ideas breed among them. As with a lot of things appreciating our new residence was a matter of perception and Paul had a good one. A tasty burrito and a drink at the local later, everybody was tucked into their creeky beds. I don’t know about the others, but I couldn’t sleep with all the excitement pumping through my veins.<br>We awoke in the wee hours, helped ourselves to some breakfast courtesy of Vic the house owner and assembled at the LoopUp offices in Downtown San Francisco. LoopUp is one of the start-ups hosting three of the interns on the programme (Paul, Steward and Chris), whose co-CEO Mike Hughes also happens to be the founder of the SVIP and a great guy. So the LoopUp offices doubles up quite nicely as the SVIP HQ, with the added bonus of having a pool table and beer on tap. Once we’d gotten everyone over the painfully necessary admin hurdles, it was time for a little orientation. Lunch in a nice restaurant nearby and straight on to witness first hand what San Francisco entrepreneur Mark Dwight of Rickshaw bags had been busy with.<br>Over in Dogpatch area of San Francisco a bag manufacturer has taken residence in a big wooden hangar. Mark Dwight, who formerly worked in Silicon Valley’s tech sector decided to organize something more tangible. The company makes bags to order, in small batches by a crazy-efficient team. Mark ran us throught the materials, process and most importantly infected us with his enthusiasm for making a great product. For the lowdown on Rickshaw bags, check out Matt’s blog post and whilst you’re at it make your own.<br>The remainder the weekend was spent checking out the peer, getting to know one another over a sampling of local beers and hitting our local. On Sunday morning Mario Hayashi, Michael Howell and I were due to travel south to San Jose to start our internships with Nimble Storage. Michael Hughes kindly drove us to our hotel, but not before letting us sample some burgers from In-n-Out for the genuine Cali experience.<br>Needless to say I was stunned by the luxury of the hotel which Nimble Storage had arranged for us especially after my 5 years of student living. Thanks Nimble. I felt out of place, but mustered the courage to appreciate it whilst it lasted. Monday was our first day at work.<br>The first few days in SF were most memorable and were also set in ink by Paul, Lee, Matt, Stewart, Chris A, Chris H and primarily pixels by Barnaby - check em out!</p>
