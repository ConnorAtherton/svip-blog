Yes, the rumours are true! Applications for the 2016 intake of the Silicon Valley Internship Programme will be closing at midnight (PST) on Sunday, February 1st. If you are a Computer Science graduate (or are graduating this year) from a British University and you want to unleash your entrepreneurial spirit in the techy-cauldron of dreams that is Silicon Valley, then stop what you’re doing, don’t even bother reading the rest of this blog, and apply to the Silicon Valley Internship Programme right now by clicking here!

Why are you still reading this? I told you to apply!

What’s that? You want to find out more about the application process and you’re hoping that this blog will shed some light on it? Oh you! You know me too well…

Clicking the ‘Apply’ button on www.siliconvalleyinternship.com (which is the same links as the once I gave above) takes you to Cruity, an awesome recruitment platform currently being developed by an SVIP alumni. The application form on Cruity requires you to fill a standard set of details about yourself e.g. name, e-mail address, degree etc.

In the application, we really want you to show us how you sit in that sweet-stop between having the spirit of an entrepreneur, and the skills of a developer-ninja. Therefore, feel free to take time with your application to make sure that it shows you off in the best possible light, and don’t be afraid to brag!

The fun really starts at the ‘Additional 4’ field, where you will be faced with a coding challenge! The coding challenge is not a walk in the park so getting the correct answer will really help your application. However, if you really want to set yourself apart from the crowd then you should consider how you answer the coding challenge – you will want your coding challenge answer to stand out from the crowd as much as the rest of your application does.

As a final incentive, we've collated all of the 'SVIP Tips' from @SVIPUK to help you make your application sizzle.

Good luck!
