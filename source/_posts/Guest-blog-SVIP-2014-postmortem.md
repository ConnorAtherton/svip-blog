Well it’s been a whole year. A whole year and I can hardly believe it. Still time waits for no man and myself and the rest of the SVIP Class of 2014 are soon to move on to greener pastures, exciting new projects and adventures.

I asked a few of my fellow SVIPers to sum up their time with the SVIP. Barnaby reflects – “I feel this year has given me an informed insight and opinion on this profession, the sector and Silicon Valley. It has put a lot into perspective for me, as well as obviously learning a great deal. The biggest thing I think though is that it has helped me start to form an idea of what I want to be doing in the future.” Chris and Nick whole-heartedly agree, saying more people should apply. And I think it’s clear from any one of our faces that we’re all taking away something money can’t buy from this experience.

Over the course of the year, many startup ideas floated around amongst the SVIPers. Some disappeared into thin air, some took shape and a few made it into the hands of their first users. Of particular note is the project to build a SaaS web-store plugin. Its creator (who prefers to stay anonymous) succeeded in getting funding to further develop his idea but chose to do so whilst working full-time. “The money offered by some of the startups is just too tempting” he says, and it’s true for the rest of us. Stewart too has decided to combine full-time work and further development of “Cruity” a custom recruitment platform used by the SVIP to power its own application process and a worthy competitor to Resumator.

But what are the things that we would do differently, given the chance? In my peers’ words:
- Be more focused
- Carve out time at the weekends towards hacking
- Attend more startup events
- Spend more time with my mentor
- Finish the side projects

Although these may sound specific to startups and software engineering, they’re really not that different from what many aspiring young people go through during this time of their lives. It’s about searching for meaningful work, that speaks to our purpose, removing unnecessary distractions and fully actualizing that initial flood of inspiration. Looking at the list above, a nagging question enters my mind, “have I done enough this year?”.

Recently we’ve all been tuning in to a Stanford lecture series on “How to start a startup”, where Sam Altman pointed out that one of the biggest regrets of company founders is choosing an idea which didn’t quite resonate with them. And for this resonance to occur, queue cliche, the founders must “know themselves”.

Throughout the year I’ve heard some great advice from company founders. Amongst them was the surprisingly simple and reassuring words from Nimble Storage’s Varun and Umesh:

> “Find the industry which you want to innovate in, work in a good company within this industry, succeed and don’t be afraid to quit when the right idea comes knocking on the door.”

What this says to me is that there’s no need to rush into a startup which you don’t feel passionate about, but you can build up to it by working on projects which really interest you with people you really like. And it gives me great clarity to see this opinion seconded in “Before the Startup” by Paul Graham. It’s the simple “do what you want” rule of thumb which feels so true, one that I hear over and over and over.

Undoubtedly, this year in Silicon Valley has been a journey of personal growth for us all. So perhaps the greatest thing about the SVIP, is that it has given us a chance to experiment, experience and learn by working in the environment in which we want to innovate in. Through a myriad events, founder meetups, hackathons, parties, road trips we’ve all weathered and reflected on our own powers and what we can achieve with them, and hopefully gained a better appreciation for the people who make our lives worthwhile.

Special thanks to Mike Hughes for reaching out and Naomi Coe for herding the cats, we hope to one day return the favor.
