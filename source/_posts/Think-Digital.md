One of the great things about living in Silicon Valley is that there are so many exciting tech events right on your doorstep. From casual meetups, to events aimed at teaching you everything your start up needs to know and official product launches it’s actually possible to go to a different event every night of the week. We checked in with SVIPer Flavius Popescu to hear about some of the events he’s been to lately.

-------------------------------

Since arriving here I have been able to visit Stanford University’s campus buildings for a presentation on Deep Learning and its applications, with prominent industry experts working on fascinating projects including [clarifai](http://www.clarifai.com) and Google Brain. On another occasion I travelled to the Mountain View Googleplex to watch the Google Android experts discuss Material Design and Android L. After numerous examples of good interaction design and proper use of UI elements, the discussion carried on until late with Q&A. These events have been packed and it’s been really interesting to meet people who come from all walks of life. 

I also attended the Internet Of Things Cross-meetup recently, which approached topics like wearables/mobile, VR/sensors, machine learning and biofeedback. The demos here were formidable. In fact I’m still thinking about a couple of them…

###Leap Motion

What do you get when you put together Oculus and Leap? A fantastic VR experience! "Oculeap" not only puts you into a magical world of wonder, it lets you play with everything in it too.

The small sensor mounted on the VR headset brings together 3D rendering and 3D interaction. The Leap Motion team boasts a highly responsive interface that instantly provides feedback on hand and finger motion, to a very high degree of accuracy. Almost every knuckle is tracked as a degree of freedom and a kind of guideline-skeleton is displayed in front of your eyes:

It goes without saying, it was really cool trying that out! And whilst I normally try to be courteous to the ones around me, I found it very hard to switch back to that physical surrounding of mine which included a fairly lengthy queue of people, eager to give it a shot as well. After only one or two minutes spent with the Oculeap, I’m not sure if I was disappointed coming back to the real world, or just left wondering about all the possible applications that this device might have. Imagine brain surgery being performed remotely, if you hook this up to a robot arm. Or a 3D controller for semi-autonomous vehicles. Robotics aside, I’m pretty sure such a device could launch a whole new way of expressing oneself in the arts, or perhaps change the way visitors in a museum interact with exhibits on display. In education, simulation and training there are probably countless possibilities. In fact, as one of the demonstrators put it, “[opportunities] will only be limited by the developer’s imagination”.

Such a device really makes you wonder, how do we actually feel about the digital world? What is digital stuff? We use this digital space to store a significant number of aspects from our life, in the form of digital text, picture, video or even 3D objects. Pretty soon we’ll be able to witness and experience a better way of interacting with all this content. And this type of interaction may be more appealing to our senses that are already great at absorbing the physical world around us. As physical beings we respond well to the idea that everything is made of a certain material. Could *digital* be one such material as well? Will we look at a digital media device and claim it’s made of plastic, glass as well as digital stuff? As the company’s CTO and cofounder mentioned, we may discover a “totally new foundational aspect of the world”.

### Prediction IO

The team from Prediction IO started by voicing the motivation behind their product. Applying machine learning (ML) to solve any problem requires advanced mathematical skills and perhaps even a PhD (which  may further involve funding issues and a significant time commitment).

It would be great if developers could use readily-available, open-source modules to fulfill the learning needs in their projects, without the prerequisite of being a machine learning specialist. They would just take an existing module, feed training data to it and then get prediction results. However, as one gentleman from the audience rightly noticed, although commodifying machine learning know-how is a very welcome endeavor, what do you do about parameter tuning?

Let’s say you train a classifier and come up with a set of seemingly good model parameters that you are happy with, since they perform well on both a test and a validation set. What do you do when you discover your classifier performs badly on new examples? Furthermore, perhaps the training phase alone indicates unacceptable validation errors. Does your model have a high bias, or are you overfitting the data? Should you spend time on getting lots and lots more training data or should you save your budget and look elsewhere? Surely one may argue that being able to answer these kinds of questions is precisely why people get PhDs.

It depends. I think some of these questions can be readily answered without being a machine learning expert. That is not to say any skilled coder who also did well in a machine learning class will solve all your product’s problems. Instead, the idea is that a small amount of understanding of ML concepts could go a long way in terms of improving algorithm performance and can help focus your resources on what truly has impact.

With Prediction IO, the main focus may not necessarily be helping users tune their algorithms. But having some core building blocks readily available when you just want to get started is tremendously useful. And I certainly like the idea of an open source machine learning server backed by a wonderful community of developers and ML enthusiasts.

---------------------------

Attending events like these is a really great way for SVIPers to check out what’s new and exciting in Silicon Valley, not to mention meeting like-minded people and learning from them. 

If you’re interested in Machine Learning, you’re in luck because there are some great online MOOCs that can get you started now. Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning class on Coursera.org (https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) is definitely worth taking, and it’s free! Even if it won’t teach you how to derive the different algorithms (apart from hinting at it), it will show you how to use them in your projects and give you advice on applying the different concepts. 

Look forward to seeing your ideas at a Silicon Valley tech event soon!
