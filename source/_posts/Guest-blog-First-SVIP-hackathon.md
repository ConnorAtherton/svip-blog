Last weekend we held our very first SVIP hackathon. It was a surprisingly unrushed and pleasant affair much different to what I'd experienced before during game jams. Personally I think that it was the familiarity and homeliness of the LoopUp offices that did it. Stewart, Paul, Naomi, Ben, Mario, Michael, Chris A, Chris H all attended to work on their ideas.

Mario, Mike and I drove up along the now familiar 101 from San Jose into San Francisco that rainy evening to greet everyone else. Having worked on a project together for Angel Hack we decided to try our luck at individual projects. In light of upcoming St Valentine's day, I opted to appify an earlier program which could produce musical countdowns. The concept is simple: create a countdown via mobile-web interface where for each day the giftee can see a new song, picture and quote of your choosing but only once.

I drafted my UX design many times on paper that evening, starting with 9 screens and ending with just 4. Saturday and Sunday morning were spent implementing.

For a simple app like this, paper prototyping really worked because I could iterate quickly and have a clean implementation plan. Once a design was ready I could imagine what it would be like to use the app and modify anything that didn't work.

For the implementation I used Bootstrap, Backbone.js, Parse.com since I'd been learning them already. Despite having a design I still ended up spending most of my time adjusting the UI. I recall feeling that in comparison to the ideas of the others mine seemed insignificant, but at some point I tuned out the doubts with some music and got coding.

Other ideas that were developed that weekend included a web-based job applications software, collaborative software lib, distributed system for doing cheeky things with BitCoins, email revolutionizer and an app that was aimed at improving company communication. All worthy challenges which address real-world problems.

Between coding we played ping-pong (Chris and Paul being ridiculously good since they work at LoopUp and play every day), had coffee, did Subway runs for breakfast, lunch and dinner and had a couple of beers. After 6 months people had gelled together well and there was a definite sense of camaraderie.

Both nights I'd spent sleeping comfortably on the floor listening to the rain ceaselessly overflowing the gutters. It reminded me of the UK.

Sunday was the day of “judging” with three startup old-hands attending. I quote “judging” as it was more like a brainstorming session discussing the potentials of each idea, downsides, areas to focus and danger zones. The main purpose of which was of course to nudge us into action and actually starting a company. Several of us have already started working on startup ideas, which is reassuring – all it takes is to choose a direction and start walking.

**Takeaways:**
- Paper prototype – quick, easy, saves time in the long run
- Get your head down – even if others don't get your idea, get it done, make a prototype, I've found that a working program was far more convincing, it's the [old stone soup principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup)
- Choose a big problem – don't be afraid of addressing something tough, it will naturally stimulate conversation from others
