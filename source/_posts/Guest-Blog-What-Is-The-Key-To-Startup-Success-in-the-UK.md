With my graduation ceremony marking the end of one journey tomorrow, a new journey awaits me when I move to San Francisco this September. I feel very fortunate to be part of the inaugural class of the Silicon Valley Internship Programme. You can watch my 1-minute video intro here.

I began preparing for the journey ahead of me by attending the Pubsummit event on July 8th, hosted by GigaOM; I wasn't sure what to expect, as this was the first networking event I have attended in a bar! It was a warm and sunny evening in the city so I was relieved to find upon arrival that the venue was shaded. Courtesy of the kind folks at Gecoboard, I was immediately given two free drinks vouchers. There was a welcoming buzz of conversation in the air and I couldn't wait to get involved.

One of my goals for my year in the Silicon Valley is to pick up the skills necessary to run a successful startup when I return to the UK. To prepare for this, I decided to ask everyone I spoke with about what they thought was important for new startups and the startup community in the UK as a whole.

Having ordered a Tequila Lemonade, I put on my investigative hat and began taking part in some very interesting conversations.

Xen Lategan from PXi Ventures said:
> “You want the pressure of an investor. When you bootstrap, it may be safe but your velocity is also low.”

Alok Matta who has quit the corporate sphere in order to explore the startup world said:
> “There is lack of creativity in Europe. Instead of copying what has already been done and trying to solve problems that are not there, we need to focus on innovation.”

Anna Dahlström, a freelancing UX designer and founder of byflock said:
> “Know your priorities. It's easy to get sidetracked.”

Daniel Levy, the CEO of StreetLike said:
> “Get mentors as soon as you can; find people who have done what you are trying to do.”

Alec Dent, from BlaBlaCar said:
> “More people need to be willing to take the risk.”

Katherine Procopiou, from Nexmo (a worth checking out SMS API) said:
> “People need to commit beyond the 9-5 and be passionate. For this to happen we need larger scale events to connect more people and higher profile speakers to inspire the community here.”

Peter Ryder, the co-founder of Inkly said:
> “Network, but don't go looking for specific things; instead be open to opportunities. Go to events and just talk to different people. You don't have to talk to everyone either. We got everything through networking!”

I really liked the informal and relaxed atmosphere throughout and was very impressed with the calibre of people in attendance. It is something I would definitely recommend to anyone in the startup world. I am looking forward to more events like this!

I'd like to give special thanks to Patti Silverman (SVIP Program Manager) who made me aware of this fun event and to Hoshang Sadiq my good friend and co-founder, for helping me put together the material for this post.
 
What do you think is the key to startup success in the UK?
