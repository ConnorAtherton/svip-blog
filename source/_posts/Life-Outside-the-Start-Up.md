The SVIP is about much more than just day to day life working for a start-up. In fact, those who get the most out of the SVIP will be the one's who take up all the other opportunities right there on their doorstep in Silicon Valley. Every day of the week there are breakfast meet ups where people get together to bounce around ideas, networking events hosted by yet another exciting new company with the chance to get to know who's who. And we haven't even mentioned the conferences yet. Doesn't sound too interesting, a bit stuffy even? Wrong. You could learn almost anything you ever wanted to at one of the hundreds of conferences happening around the Bay Area, this is how people stay on top in a rapidly developing environment. And you almost always get a free goodie bag.

This weekend SVIP interns Paul Wozniak and Stewart Taylor took part in a hackathon hosted by [Pandora](http://hellahackoakland.splashthat.com/). “Make something cool with music” they said. “You have 32 hours. Go.”

We do have to give some credit to another SVIP intern, Mike Howell, here. Quote “Why would I want to spend all week programming for my start up, every evening working on my own project AND devote my weekend to staring at a computer screen?” Contrary to popular opinion, the SVIP does accept non super-geek candidates who like fresh air and daylight. Did we mention that there happens to be an Olympic class ski resort at Squaw Valley, just a few hours drive from San Francisco?

That said, Paul and Stewart did an awesome job representing the SVIP. Not only did they come up with working product that streams music based on your mood, they won. That means a free month of co-working space to launch it from, courtesy of [Port Work Spaces](http://www.portoffices.com/), and even more time to devote to getting square eyes. Watch this space.
