In the six months I have lived in San Francisco I have encountered a concentration of passionate people beyond anything I could have anticipated. The sheer number of start-ups that the city, and surrounding Bay Area, fosters can be attributed to a great number of factors and there are innumerable articles which try to address these. But it is this passion exhibited by the world renowned “founder” stereotype which has me fixated.

In my time here I've been to a number of “fire-side” chats, met more founders than any normal city could even contain, and had more conversations than I care to even try and count with friends about potential projects. Some of these occasions have even been interesting and/or informative. But the one nagging question that I always find myself asking is why did you choose this idea? How do you know when to just go for it and commit to something? I'm yet to receive a solid answer that really satisfies.

Like most developers, I always have a side project. If not multiple side projects. In fact since I've started recording my ideas and side projects, I can tell you that I have over one hundred. And not a single one even near completion. I could blame this on all sorts of things, like the fact that I get very excited by starting a project, or conversely that I'm too lazy to put in the time beyond that point and finish them. Forgetting the honeymoon period arguments, I am yet to find myself bursting with that pure enthusiasm and passion for an idea of my own that I've seen in so many other people.

I'll be honest, this has at times made me feel a little bit jealous. I am envious of the fact that so many people around me have fallen in love with one of their own ideas and are pursuing something that they believe in. But what grates on me most is when that idea, which is of course going to change the world, is just yet another niche social network; yet another unwanted consumer app; yet another wearable big data augmented reality digital dispatch service that's going to disrupt... pretty much nothing.

All of my British cynicism aside, I think I've had some pretty good ideas, some which definitely had more potential than fully funded companies I've encountered. So why didn't I experience that same passion? Why wasn't I burning with the desire to take that idea and force it into fruition? To see it succeed beyond anything I initially imaged? To believe in it with enough zeal to make it contagious?

After thinking long and hard a few potential reasons or causes have become apparent to me. None of them definitive, and all unlikely to be the sole motive, but strangely they all glisten with parallels to the world of dating and relationships. Let's check out the options:

Higher standards
Simply enough, other people are willing to settle for second best, or worse. A reluctance could be due to an over-inflated ego, or an inability to see the beauty inside, but I'm not sure how much effect being shallow or elitist could have on ones ideas.

Waiting for “The One”
The billion dollar idea, that elusive golden ticket, Mr Right. Whatever it's called, I do feel like I'm waiting for that concept I'd be willing to marry and settle down with. But do some people just get lucky early on, or does this boil down to the previous point of having higher or lower standards?

First love infatuation
Do people just fall in love with the first serious idea they have, and then fail to see the greener grass beyond their bubble happily ever after? Maybe, but we all know there are plenty more fish in the sea and any founder or investor who's done their market research should be able to see this for most ideas. Unless of course you have found a golden ticket, committing to the first cool idea that comes to your head may seem reckless.

Afraid of being hurt
The core concept of the Silicon Valley Internship Programme is teaching the British that it is OK to fail. It does seem possible that an openness to failure would make one more willing to take the leap of faith. But even with the knowledge that it's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all, we're still no better off knowing when to love. Unless of course you just take the first path you stumble across.

Lack of self belief
I don't think anyone would ever accuse me of this, in fact they're much more likely to call me a narcissist, but it does seem logical that if one were not to believe in oneself then one might be less inclined to pursue ones ideas.

Because you don't really want it
Almost the opposite of the fear of failure or getting hurt is the possibility of being perfectly content with being perpetually in pursuit. The start-up life is always shown to be very glamorous, young and exciting, so why not tap some of that but without any of the stress and bother of actually starting up? After all, it's not the kill, it's the thrill of the chase.

These all seem like very good reasons or even excuses not to fall in love with an idea and experience the passion, and I'm sure they're pleasing to cynics and pessimists. Even worse is the fact that the only conclusions that can be drawn from this are the cliches already in use on the other side of our analogy; “keep trying”, “don't give up”, “don't look too hard”, “it'll happen eventually”. I guess I'll just keep creating, waiting for Mr Right-Idea to come along, and hope the passion finds me eventually. And even if I become the old cat lady of entrepreneurs, I still want to hear the stories from the people out there right now with that passion, and the reasons why they seized an idea and decided to go for it.
Are you a founder? Have you turned an idea into success or failure? Share the reasons behind your decision to take that leap of faith with @barneyjackson and @SVIPUK to be part of the discussion.
