### Creating a post
```hexo new "<post_name>"```

They are located in ```source/_posts```. I've already generated 10
and they just need content copied in from the old site.

### Issue and todo
- Jamie is creating a favicon for SVIP, need to use here too
- Figure out how to embed pictures in posts, assets are served from /img/blah.png
  but need to link in posts.

### Adding posts
- The author is currently undefined so if you are copying a post put the author
  name and push so everyone knows you are working on it. Or figure out a better way.

### Checking how it looks
```
hexo generate
hexo server
localhost:4343
```

Don't worry about 404's. They get handled properly when it is deployed.
